This paper focuses on one in particular, Binary Neural Networks (BNN), which use fixed length bits in its connections and logic functions to perform excitation operations. Exploiting those characteristics, hardware accelerators that integrate field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been adopted to hasten inference of deep learning networks, given its proficiency to maximize parallelism and energy efficiency. This work will show how the algorithm Binary Spectrum-diverse Unified Neuroevolution Architecture (BiSUNA) can perform training and inference on FPGA without the need of gradient descent.
