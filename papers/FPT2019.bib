This paper presents a novel approach to train from scratch Binary Neural Networks using neuroevolution as its base technique (gradient descent free), to then apply such results to standard Reinforcement Learning environments tested in the OpenAI Gym. The results and code can be found in https://github.com/rval735/BiSUNA.}, keywords={Neuroevolution;binary neural networks;BiSUNA;discrete optimization}, doi={10.1109/APCCAS47518.2019.8953134}, ISSN={null}, month={Nov},}
